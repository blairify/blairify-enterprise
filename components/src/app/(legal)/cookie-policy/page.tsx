                Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device
                (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit websites.
                They help websites remember information about your visit, making
                your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies

              <p className="mb-4">
                Essential cookies are necessary for Blairify to function
                properly. These cookies enable core functionality such as user
                authentication, security, and accessibility features. Without
                these cookies, services you have requested cannot be provided.
                Essential cookies include authentication tokens that keep you
                logged in securely, session identifiers that maintain your
                active session while you use the platform, security cookies that
                protect against fraud and unauthorized access, and preference
                cookies that remember your settings and customization choices.
                These cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our
                service and cannot be disabled in our systems.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Analytics cookies are optional and help us understand how
                visitors interact with Blairify. These cookies collect
                information anonymously, allowing us to improve our service
                based on usage patterns. Analytics cookies help us see which
                features are most popular, identify technical issues, understand
                how users navigate through the platform, and measure the
                effectiveness of new features. You can choose to disable
                analytics cookies without affecting your ability to use
                Blairify.
