⚠️ CRITICAL - AVOID REPETITION:
Topics/concepts already covered: ${coveredTopics.length > 0 ? coveredTopics.join(", ") : "none yet"}
Previously asked questions (never repeat these or trivial rephrasings):
${previousQuestionsText}

DO NOT ask about these topics again. Instead, explore NEW areas such as:
- Different technical concepts or tools
- Alternative problem-solving scenarios
- Different aspects of the development lifecycle
- Various architectural patterns or design principles
- Different performance or optimization challenges
- Security, testing, or deployment topics not yet covered
- Team collaboration, code review, or best practices
- Real-world debugging or troubleshooting scenarios

Recent conversation:
${recentContext}

Your next question MUST be completely different from previous questions. Vary the question type (scenario-based, conceptual, practical, comparison, problem-solving). Make it specific and relevant to ${config.position} role.`;
